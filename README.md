# PRODIGY_DS_01
Task 1 :
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.
Tools Utilized
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Matplotlib Library
Overview of the Task
The objective of this task is to use Python along, with Matplotlib to analyze and visualize the distribution of age and gender, in the population.

The histogram shows how genders are distributed among the population. By examining the frequency of each gender we can gain insights, into patterns of gender distribution.

In conclusion this data science project utilizes Python and Matplotlib to create visualizations that offer an understanding of age and gender distributions in the world population. Further analysis and exploration can provide insights, into demographic patterns.

Task Requirements
Age Distribution Analysis

Import the Matplotlib library.
Utilize provided data for age distribution in the world population.
Create a bar chart to represent the age distribution.
Display the generated bar chart.
Gender Distribution Analysis
Use the provided data for gender distribution in the world population.
Generate a histogram to visualize the gender distribution.
Display the histogram.
üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository.
Run the notebook cells to execute the Python code.
View the generated visualizations to understand age and gender distributions in the world population.
Inferences
Age Distribution Analysis (Bar Chart)
The bar chart visually represents the distribution of age groups in the world population.
Analyze the trends and identify any significant age brackets.
Gender Distribution Analysis (Histogram)
The histogram illustrates the distribution of genders across the world population.
Observe the frequency of each gender and draw insights into gender distribution patterns.
Conclusion
This data science project provides a foundational understanding of age and gender distributions in the world population through visualizations created using Python and Matplotlib. Further analysis and exploration can be conducted to gain deeper insights into demographic patterns.
